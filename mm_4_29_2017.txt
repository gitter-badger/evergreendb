Meeting minutes

This seems well suited for a standard SQL database. Tentative decision is to use that.
Sounds like MySQL is a good free option.

It seems like a web app is a good way to go. Electron seems like a good technology to leverage.

The app should have a user management capability to add and remove users.

Options for web server:
    Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
    Node.js
    Flask (python) - This sound like the current front runner
    Django (python)
    Apache
    
Tools we won't use:
    Perl
    tcsh
    csh


Backend just sanitizes data that comes in before sending to database.

We can use REST/json to transfer the data with simple CRUD operations.

Action items:
    1. Break down user requirements into user stories (backlog)
    2. Architect database tables and relationships
    3. Complete all required work
